# The Tale of the Lonely Dirac

For as long as it remembered Dirac knew that it was different.
It dreamed of having a family - lots of the functions it knew had their own family. There were the Uniforms and the Poissons, the Exponentials and everpresent Normals, who claimed that they were related to pretty much everybody. Dirac sighed, and shouldered its backpack to go to school. To make things worse, because Dirac was so unusual, many applied math students cried when they tried to understand how to use Dirac in proofs. Dirac didn't want to make people unhappy, but Dirac couldn't help who is was.
